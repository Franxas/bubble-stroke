A first try at a Processing exercise.  
This is a bubble stroke tool that allows you to make bubbles appear on your canvas by simply drawing using your mouse.

-> every bubble has a random life span.  
-> click and drag your mouse to instanciate new bubbles.  
-> press 'P' key to freeze bubbles' movement  
-> press 'G' key to attract the bubbles to your mouse position oj the canvas (still needs some improvement)
